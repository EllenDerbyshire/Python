Python projects:
This repository includes various python projects to develop programming skills and a game created with the pygame library
called Monkey Madness 

To run the game you must download ALL OF THE FILES and store them in THE SAME FOLDER
Must also convert any mp3 files to wav files
To run the API code you must create your own api access key at openweathermap.org and then uncomment out the api code
